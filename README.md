# Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview

This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning. Pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening condition, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. By leveraging convolutional neural networks, the project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

## Objective

- Build and evaluate a base CNN model for binary classification of chest X-ray images.
- Implement a second model using transfer learning with a pre-trained architecture.
- Combine both models using an ensemble method to compare performance across different approaches.
- Assess model performance using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit that allows users to upload chest X-ray images and receive predictions, along with Grad-CAM visualizations highlighting regions of diagnostic interest.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), which includes labeled chest radiographs. It contains two classes:
- `NORMAL`
- `PNEUMONIA`

The data is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

## Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation tailored for medical imaging.
- A custom base CNN architecture built from scratch.
- A second model utilizing transfer learning.
- An ensemble method combining predictions from both models to evaluate performance improvements.
- Visualization of training history and prediction metrics.
- Grad-CAM heatmaps to interpret and explain model predictions.
- Streamlit-based user interface to upload chest X-rays and get real-time diagnosis with visual feedback.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn
